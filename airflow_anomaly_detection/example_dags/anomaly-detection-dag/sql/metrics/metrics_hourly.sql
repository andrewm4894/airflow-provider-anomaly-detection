This example query generates a batch of metrics for the last hour.
The metrics are generated randomly.

The outputs of the query must be in the following format:
- metric_timestamp: The timestamp of the metric.
- metric_batch_name: The name of the batch of metrics.
- metric_name: The name of the metric.
- metric_value: The value of the metric.
